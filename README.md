## Lore
You are an experienced traveller guiding your ship through the 7 seas. A hurricane has come through your area and demolished many merchant, pirate, and royal ships, leaving their loot floating in the ocean. You and your crew navigate through the ocean to collect as much loot as possible. But be weary, the ghosts of the ships are still on the water and hunt whoever dares take their loot. If the ghost ships get close enough to board, they will steal back what is rightfully, or wrongfully, theirs
